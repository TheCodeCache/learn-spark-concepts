# Encoders:
Central to the concept of `Dataset` is an `Encoder framework`,  
that provides Dataset with `storage` and `execution` efficiency gains as compared to `RDDs`.  

> An encoder of a particular type encodes either an Java object or a data record into the binary format backed by raw memory and vice-versa.  
> `Encoders are part of Sparkâ€™s tungusten framework.` Being backed by the raw memory, updation or querying of relevant information from the encoded binary text is done via Java Unsafe APIs.


**Encoder outputs - Binary Format:**

There are the 3 broad benefits provided by Encoders empowering Datasets to their present glory:  
1. Storage efficiency:
2. Query efficiency:
3. Shuffle efficiency:
